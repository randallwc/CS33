A.
Nothing prints because the thread never gets to the print because the main exits before the thread can get to the print statement.
This is because the main thread does not wait for the thread to complete before it exits.
B.
You can replace 'exit(0)' with the following commands, which will wait for the thread to finish before exiting.

Pthread_exit(NULL);
Pthread_join(tid, NULL);

Is echo_cnt thread-safe?

'echo_cnt' is thread-safe because it uses a mutex to lock and unlock when it acceses and prints the 'byte_cnt' which is a global shared variable.
This means that threads will not be able to access and read it at the same time as each other so it is safe
to be used in a thread. 

Is it reentrant?

'echo_cnt' is not reentrant because threads that call it will share the same mutex, and that does not satisfy the conditions of reentrant functions.
Reentrant functions must have all of its data references be references to local automatic stack variables, and this is not satisfied here.
